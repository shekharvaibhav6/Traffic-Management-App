# 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Management System 🚦

🌟 Overview

This project demonstrates an innovative Intelligent Traffic Management System designed to optimize urban traffic flow using Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, and SQL. It features real-time data streaming, dynamic traffic signal control, and fast data access. The architecture is modular and scalable, built with microservices for efficient management and maintenance.

🛠️ Key Features

Real-Time Traffic Signal Control 🟢🟡🔴
Adjusts traffic signals dynamically based on live vehicle count data from intersections.
Real-Time Data Streaming with Kafka 🎉📊
Uses Kafka for processing live traffic data streams, enabling quick decision-making and system responsiveness.
Fast Data Access with Redis ⚡
Caches frequently accessed traffic data to ensure high-speed retrieval and reduce latency.
Data Logging in SQL Database 🗃️
Stores traffic data and signal adjustments in a SQL database for long-term analysis and reporting.
Microservices Architecture 🔧
Modular services for traffic signal management, monitoring, and notifications, promoting scalability and maintainability.
🖥️ Technologies Used

Spring Boot: Java-based framework for building microservices
Kafka: Real-time event streaming and message brokering
Redis: In-memory data store for caching and fast access
SQL Database: Persistent storage for traffic data and logs
Docker: Containerization for seamless deployment and scalability
⚡ Architecture Overview

The system is composed of the following microservices:

Traffic Signal Service 🛑: Manages the state of traffic signals at intersections.
Traffic Monitoring Service 🚗: Collects and processes data on vehicle counts at intersections.
Notification Service 📲: Sends alerts to authorities based on traffic conditions or system malfunctions.
Data Persistence 🗃️: Stores traffic logs and historical data in a SQL database for future analysis.
The services communicate asynchronously using Kafka for real-time data streaming, with Redis caching critical data for improved performance.

🚀 How It Works

Real-Time Data Collection 🛰️
Traffic data (e.g., vehicle counts) is sent to Kafka from monitoring sensors placed at traffic intersections.
Dynamic Signal Adjustment 🚦
The traffic signal service uses the vehicle count data to dynamically adjust the signal colors (green, yellow, red) to optimize traffic flow.
Data Caching 💾
Frequently accessed traffic data, such as current traffic conditions at intersections, is cached in Redis to provide rapid access.
Historical Data Storage 📚
Traffic logs are stored in a SQL database for analysis and reporting purposes.
Real-Time Alerts 📢
The notification service alerts authorities about any significant traffic issues or malfunctions.
🏆 Achievements

Real-time Traffic Management 🌍
Achieved dynamic control over traffic signals based on live data, reducing congestion.
Scalable System Architecture 🔝
The microservices-based design allows the system to scale as needed for larger cities and more intersections.
Performance Optimization ⚙️
Redis caching reduces latency, ensuring fast data retrieval and system responsiveness.
